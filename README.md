# Chess-App

## About The Project
Simple chess web application written using `React` and `TypeScript`

Some notes:
- All pieces move properly
- En passant for pawns
- Promotion for pawns
- Castle for kings
- Moves history (algebraic notation)
- Option to revert moves
- Game timer, game restart
- Checkmate, king can't move into danger
- no AI, player plays as both black and white
- TODO: on check, pieces can still move as usual. Instead they should be allowed to move only to cells that protect king
